# Resume maker project

this project was created to set the need for resume maker in my class

## about the project

this project is divided into two main parts, the beautiful styling of the resume and the design of the website itself and a basic use 
of hoks and forms in react, we wanted to make it as close as possible to a real CV-MAKER website.

at the end of the prosses, you can download your PDF file for free!

### why I did this project
